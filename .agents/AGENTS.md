# Pocket Gull Workspace Rules

## Node.js Version
- **Strict Requirement**: Use **Node.js v24.x** for all local development, testing, and CI/CD pipelines. This is configured in `.node-version`, `.nvmrc`, and root `package.json` (`engines`).

## Package Overrides (esbuild Version Mismatch Workaround)
- To prevent version mismatch crashes with `esbuild` in the monorepo workspace environment, `esbuild` version overrides are structured as follows:
  - **Global default override**: Set `esbuild` (and all platform binaries `@esbuild/*`) to `0.27.2`.
  - **Angular CLI specific override**: Override `esbuild` (and all platform-specific `@esbuild/*` binaries) to `0.28.1` specifically under `@angular/build` and `@angular-devkit/build-angular`.
  - **Astro Promotion**: `astro` and `@astrojs/mdx` are included as direct root devDependencies to ensure their transitive `esbuild` dependencies are correctly caught by the root context overrides, bypassing npm workspace link boundary resolution bugs.
- **Note**: Do not modify these overrides without full regression testing of both the Angular build and the Astro `docs-study` workspace build.
