## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- **Offline Printable Stationery**: CSS Grid-optimized, multi-page physical printouts featuring Halftone body maps for visual pain hotspot diagnosis.
- **Smartwatch Optimization**: Responsive UI scaling down to extremely constrained viewports (e.g., Pixel Watch 2 at 286px width).
- **Box Breathing UX**: 16-second box breathing visual animations integrated into primary intake text areas to promote practitioner mindfulness.

### Changed
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Transitioned architecture to Angular SSR for performance optimization.
- **Mobile Navigation**: Implemented tabbed view-switching (Tasks / Analysis) optimized for constrained mobile environments.

### Fixed
- **SSR Build Stability**: Resolved "no exports" optimization bailouts caused by unresolved TypeScript properties in `PatientStateService`.
- **Mobile Scrolling**: Fixed mobile page scrolling flow by removing forced height constraints.
- **UI Clipping**: Fixed horizontal/vertical clipping of action buttons and contents in the analysis report.
- **Type Safety**: Ensured strict type checking and proper exports for patient history and summary models across services.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **Care Plan Recommendation Engine**: A structured AI analysis module categorizing recommendations into Overview, Interventions, Monitoring, and Education.
- **Task Bracketing System**: Interactive UI allowing clinicians to Accept, Reject, or Modify AI-generated interventions before finalizing.
- **Live Voice Consult (Aura)**: An integrated voice assistant agent for real-time collaboration on patient strategies. Includes a dedicated chat interface with speech-to-text integration.
- **3D Body Viewer Integration**: Visual anatomical mapping tools to correlate physical symptoms with digital chart records.
- **Automated Clinical Task Extraction**: Parses unstructured clinical notes into actionable checklist items.
- **Biometric Telemetry Visualization**: Chart.js integration providing retrospective trend analysis for patient blood pressure and pain metrics.
- **Preview & Print Final Care Plan**: A dedicated modal to review, edit, and print the finalized patient care strategy before charting.

### Changed
- Re-architected core layouts for a responsive 3-column split view (Medical Chart, Intake Flow, and Analysis/Voice Assistant).
- Optimized client-side payload delivery via Express compression (Gzip/Brotli) and structural font preconnections.
- Upgraded UI interactions with modern tailwind aesthetics, smooth transitions, and dynamic hover states across all components.

### Fixed
- Addressed infinite reactivity loops within the Intake Form component upon body part selection.
- Corrected Voice Assistant triggering bugs preventing the component from rendering on mobile and desktop viewports.
- Handled improper API Key rejection formatting from the Gemini API service, surfacing graceful UI alerts instead of silent failures.
